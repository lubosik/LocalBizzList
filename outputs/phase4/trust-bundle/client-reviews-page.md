## H2: Client Reviews by City

### H3: Miami Reviews

**Review 1** (5-star):
**Restaurant**: La Cocina Cubana, Little Havana
**Date**: January 2025
**Rating**: ★★★★★ (5/5)

> "LocalBizzList saved us when we failed our health inspection. They came same-day, cleaned our hood to bare metal, and had our Certificate of Performance ready in 24 hours. The bi-lingual crew communicated perfectly with our kitchen staff. We passed our re-inspection with flying colors!"

**Verified**: Google Business Profile

---

**Review 2** (5-star):
**Restaurant**: Brickell Steakhouse, Brickell
**Date**: December 2024
**Rating**: ★★★★★ (5/5)

> "We're on the 25th floor and most hood cleaners won't even give us a quote because of roof access challenges. LocalBizzList's rope access certified team handled it like pros. They worked after-hours so we didn't lose dinner service. The before/after photos were impressive."

**Verified**: Yelp

---

**Review 3** (4-star):
**Restaurant**: Wynwood Brewery + Kitchen
**Date**: November 2024
**Rating**: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

> "Great service overall. Showed up on time, cleaned thoroughly, left the kitchen spotless. Only reason for 4 stars is pricing was slightly higher than competitors, but you get what you pay for - the photo documentation and professionalism were worth it."

**Verified**: Google Business Profile

**LocalBizzList Response**:
> Thank you for the feedback! We appreciate the note on pricing transparency. Our instant quote calculator shows exactly what you'll pay, and we include photo documentation, Certificate of Performance, and 3-year digital storage that competitors charge extra for.

### H3: Boca Raton Reviews

**Review 4** (5-star):
**Restaurant**: Royal Palm Country Club, Boca Raton
**Date**: December 2024
**Rating**: ★★★★★ (5/5)

> "As a private club, we have high expectations for vendors. LocalBizzList exceeded them. White-glove service, discreet crews, and meticulous attention to detail. They coordinated with our events calendar to avoid member disruption. The general manager personally reviewed the before/after photos with us. Highly recommend for luxury venues."

**Verified**: Direct Client Feedback

**Review 5** (5-star):
**Restaurant**: Mizner Park Bistro, Boca Raton
**Date**: January 2025
**Rating**: ★★★★★ (5/5)

> "We were buying this restaurant and needed a hood inspection for due diligence. LocalBizzList provided a detailed report with photos showing the system needed $3,500 in repairs. We used this to negotiate the sale price down. They came back after closing to do the cleaning and repairs. Great experience from start to finish."

### H3: Fort Lauderdale Reviews

**Review 6** (5-star):
**Restaurant**: Port Everglades Terminal Food Court
**Date**: November 2024
**Rating**: ★★★★★ (5/5)

> "Our cruise ship catering kitchen needed TWIC-certified contractors for port access. LocalBizzList was the only company that had TWIC credentials ready to go. They worked around ship schedules and completed the job overnight. Certificate of Performance delivered on time for our next sail date. Will use again."

**Review 7** (5-star):
**Restaurant**: Las Olas Seafood Grill, Fort Lauderdale
**Date**: December 2024
**Rating**: ★★★★★ (5/5)

> "We're right on the water and salt air corrodes everything faster. LocalBizzList treated our exhaust fan with coastal corrosion protection as part of the cleaning - no extra charge. Fan runs quieter now and we've had zero rust issues. They know South Florida conditions."
