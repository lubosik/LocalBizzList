#### H2: Why Insurance & Licensing Matter

**Copy Prompt** (200-300 words):
Explain risks of hiring uninsured/unlicensed contractors:

- **Liability Risk**: If uninsured contractor damages your property or causes injury, YOU may be liable
- **Workers' Comp Risk**: If unlicensed worker is injured on-site, your restaurant could face lawsuit
- **Code Violations**: Some jurisdictions require licensed contractors for NFPA 96 work
- **Insurance Claims**: Your insurance may deny fire claims if hood cleaning wasn't performed by licensed/certified contractor

**Red Flags** to watch for:
- ❌ Contractor refuses to provide COI
- ❌ "Cash only" pricing (suggests unlicensed)
- ❌ No business license or out-of-state license
- ❌ Technician can't produce IKECA or NFPA 96 certification
- ❌ Certificate of Performance has no license/cert numbers

**Green Flags** (LocalBizzList):
- ✅ Provides COI immediately upon request
- ✅ Lists Additional Insured at no extra charge
- ✅ Licensed in all 3 counties (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach)
- ✅ IKECA-certified technicians
- ✅ Digital certificate library for your records

**Description**: See our before/after photo documentation proving NFPA 96 "to bare metal" cleaning. Every job includes digital photo proof. (135 chars)
**Keywords**: to bare metal hood cleaning, before after hood cleaning photos, NFPA 96 photo documentation

}
```

### Sections

#### H1: "To Bare Metal" Photo Documentation

**Intro Copy** (100-150 words):
> NFPA 96 requires hood cleaning "to bare metal" - meaning ALL grease buildup must be removed until the original stainless steel surface is visible. But how do you know your contractor actually did this?

> LocalBizzList provides photographic proof of every cleaning with timestamped before/after photos. Your photos are included with your Certificate of Performance and stored in our digital archive for insurance and compliance audits.

> See examples below of what "to bare metal" really means, and why most contractors can't (or won't) provide proof.

---

#### H2: What "To Bare Metal" Means (NFPA 96 Standard)

**Copy Prompt** (200-250 words):
Explain NFPA 96 Chapter 11.4 cleaning requirements:

**NFPA 96, Section 11.4.2**:
> "The entire exhaust system shall be inspected and cleaned to bare metal by a properly trained, qualified, and certified company or person(s) acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction."

**"Bare Metal" Defined**:
- ALL grease removed from hood, ducts, and fan
- Original stainless steel surface visible
- No residue, film, or buildup remaining
- Includes corners, seams, welds, and hidden areas

**Why It Matters**:
- Grease buildup = fire fuel
- Even thin film can ignite and spread through ductwork
- Health inspectors check for bare metal with flashlight/mirror
- Fire marshals can cite restaurants for inadequate cleaning

**Common Shortcuts** (what competitors do):
- ❌ Surface wiping only (leaves grease in ducts)
- ❌ Visible areas only (ignores ductwork and fan)
- ❌ Chemical spray without scrubbing (cosmetic clean)
- ❌ Skip filters or fan blades

**Our Standard** (what LocalBizzList does):
- ✅ Hand scraping + pressure washing
- ✅ Full duct access (roof to hood)
- ✅ Fan disassembly and degreasing
- ✅ Filter soaking and scrubbing
- ✅ Photo proof of EVERY step

---

#### H2: Our Photo Documentation Process

##### H3: Step 1 - Before Photos (Pre-Cleaning)
**Copy**:
Before we start any work, our technician photographs:
1. Hood canopy interior (all 4 sides + top)
2. Grease filters (in place, then removed)
3. Duct access points (looking up into ductwork)
4. Exhaust fan (blades, motor housing, grease cups)
5. Grease buildup close-ups (worst areas)

**Photos**: 10-15 before shots minimum

**Timestamp**: All photos have date/time stamp

**Example Before Photos** (embed 4-6 before photos):
- Hood interior caked with black grease
- Filters with heavy buildup
- Duct interior showing grease dripping
- Exhaust fan blades coated

---

##### H3: Step 2 - Cleaning In Progress
**Copy**:
During cleaning, we document key steps:
1. Hood scraping and degreasing
2. Filter cleaning (soaking tank or pressure wash)
3. Duct access and cleaning
4. Fan cleaning and inspection
5. Containment setup (tarps, grease collection)

**Photos**: 5-10 progress shots

**Example Progress Photos** (embed 3-4 photos):
- Technician scraping hood interior
- Filters in degreasing solution
- Pressure washing ductwork
- Fan disassembly

---

##### H3: Step 3 - After Photos (Post-Cleaning)
**Copy**:
After cleaning, we photograph the same areas to show bare metal results:
1. Hood canopy interior (shiny stainless steel)
2. Clean filters (silver, no grease residue)
3. Duct interior (bare metal visible)
4. Exhaust fan (clean blades, grease-free motor)
5. Compliance sticker affixed to hood access panel

**Photos**: 10-15 after shots minimum

**Comparison**: Side-by-side before/after for key areas

**Example After Photos** (embed 4-6 after photos):
- Hood interior reflecting light (bare metal)
- Clean filters (bright silver)
- Duct interior (no grease, smooth walls)
- Clean exhaust fan (grease-free blades)
- Metal compliance sticker on access panel

#### H2: Why Most Competitors Don't Provide Photos

**Copy Prompt** (150-200 words):
Explain why photos are rare in the industry:

**Reason 1: They Don't Clean to Bare Metal**
Most hood cleaners do surface-level work that wouldn't look good in photos. Photos expose shortcuts.

**Reason 2: No Accountability**
Without photos, it's your word vs. theirs if something goes wrong. Photos create accountability they want to avoid.

**Reason 3: Lack of Professionalism**
Taking quality before/after photos requires time, equipment, and training. Many competitors lack the professionalism.

**Reason 4: Fear of Comparison**
Photos allow customers to compare quality across contractors. Low-quality work becomes obvious.

**Our Philosophy**:
We WANT you to compare our work. Photos prove we deliver on our "to bare metal" promise and justify our transparent pricing.

---

#### H2: Using Photos for Compliance & Insurance

**Copy**:
Your photo documentation can be used for:

- **Health Inspections**: Show inspector you recently cleaned to bare metal
- **Fire Marshal Audits**: Prove NFPA 96 compliance
- **Insurance Claims**: Evidence of proper maintenance (can reduce fire claim denials)
- **Lease Compliance**: Provide landlord with proof of hood cleaning per lease terms
- **Acquisition Due Diligence**: Show buyers condition of kitchen exhaust system (Boca Raton specialty)
- **Franchise Compliance**: Corporate HQ often requires photo proof

**Retention**: We retain all photos for 3 years minimum (NFPA 96 recommendation).
