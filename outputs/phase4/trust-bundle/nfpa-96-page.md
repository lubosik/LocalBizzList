## H2: What is NFPA 96?

**Copy** (200-250 words):

**NFPA 96 Definition**:
NFPA 96 is published by the National Fire Protection Association and establishes minimum fire safety requirements for commercial cooking operations. It covers:
- Kitchen exhaust system design
- Installation standards
- Operation and maintenance
- Inspection and cleaning requirements

**Why It Exists**:
Commercial kitchens produce grease-laden vapors that accumulate in hoods, ducts, and fans. This grease is highly flammable. NFPA 96 exists to prevent grease fires from starting and spreading through exhaust systems.

**Authority in Florida**:
- **State Fire Marshal** enforces NFPA 96 in Florida
- **Local Fire Departments** conduct inspections per NFPA 96
- **Health Departments** reference NFPA 96 for cleanliness standards
- **Building Departments** require NFPA 96 compliance for permits
- **Insurance Companies** require NFPA 96 compliance for fire coverage

**Current Edition**: NFPA 96-2021 (adopted in Florida)
**Next Edition**: NFPA 96-2024 (review cycle every 3 years)

## H2: NFPA 96 Cleaning Requirements (Chapter 11)

### H3: Section 11.4 - Cleaning Frequency

**Copy**:
NFPA 96 Section 11.4.2 mandates cleaning frequency based on cooking volume and type:

**Table: Cleaning Frequency Requirements**

| Cooking Type | Hours of Operation | Required Cleaning Frequency |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Systems serving solid fuel cooking** (charcoal, wood, mesquite) | Any | **Monthly** |
| **Systems serving high-volume operations** (24-hour diners, fast food with heavy frying) | 24/7 or heavy grease production | **Quarterly** (every 3 months) |
| **Systems serving moderate-volume operations** (full-service restaurants, hotels) | 6-12 hours/day | **Semi-Annually** (every 6 months) |
| **Systems serving low-volume operations** (churches, senior centers, seasonal) | <6 hours/day or infrequent use | **Annually** (every 12 months) |
| **Systems with wok cooking** (Chinese restaurants, high-heat stir-fry) | Any | **Quarterly** (minimum) |

**South Florida Application**:
- **Miami-Dade County** enforces NFPA 96 frequency via health department
- **Broward County** (Fort Lauderdale) requires NFPA 96 compliance for business licenses
- **Palm Beach County** (Boca Raton) fire marshal inspections check cleaning dates

**Red Flag**: If your hood cleaner suggests annual cleaning for a busy restaurant, they're not following NFPA 96.

## H2: Common NFPA 96 Questions

### FAQ Schema
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [ ... ]
}
```

**Q1: Does NFPA 96 apply to food trucks?**
A: Yes, if the food truck has a hood and exhaust system. NFPA 96 applies to all commercial cooking, mobile or stationary.

**Q2: Can I clean my own hood to comply with NFPA 96?**
A: NFPA 96 Section 11.4.2 requires cleaning by "properly trained, qualified, and certified" persons. Most health departments require a licensed contractor.

**Q3: How do I prove NFPA 96 compliance during a health inspection?**
A: Show the health inspector your Certificate of Performance and the metal sticker on your hood access panel.

**Q4: What happens if I miss my NFPA 96 cleaning deadline?**
A: Schedule cleaning immediately. Late cleaning is better than no cleaning. You may face violations if inspected before cleaning.

**Q5: Does NFPA 96 require monthly filter cleaning?**
A: NFPA 96 requires hood system cleaning per frequency table. Filters should be cleaned daily or per manufacturer specs (separate requirement).

**Q6: Can I use a pressure washer to clean my hood myself?**
A: You can clean the hood canopy exterior, but NFPA 96 requires professional cleaning of the entire exhaust system (hood interior, ducts, fan).

**Q7: What if my lease requires hood cleaning but doesn't specify NFPA 96?**
A: Follow NFPA 96 frequency anyway. It's the industry standard and what health/fire inspectors will expect.

**Q8: Does NFPA 96 apply to residential kitchens?**
A: No, NFPA 96 is for commercial cooking only. Residential kitchens are covered by NFPA 54 (fuel gas) and local building codes.

**Q9: How long should I keep Certificates of Performance?**
A: Minimum 3 years. Some insurance policies require 5 years of documentation.

**Q10: Is NFPA 96 the same as NFPA 17A (fire suppression)?**
