### Email Body

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm [Your Name] from LocalBizzList, an NFPA 96 certified hood cleaning company serving South Florida restaurants.

I noticed your recent coverage of [recent restaurant/fire story] and wanted to share some alarming data that might interest your readers:

**Key Statistics** (from our work with 100+ South Florida restaurants):
- 40% of Miami-Dade restaurants we inspect have overdue hood cleanings
- Grease buildup is the #1 cause of commercial kitchen fires
- Health inspections increasingly cite NFPA 96 non-compliance
- Many restaurants don't know quarterly cleaning is required for high-volume kitchens

**Story Angle Ideas**:
1. "Are South Florida Restaurants Ignoring Fire Safety?"
2. "The Hidden Costs of Skipping Hood Cleaning"
3. "New NFPA 96 Requirements Catching Restaurants Off Guard"

I'd be happy to provide:
- Expert commentary on NFPA 96 standards
- Before/after photos of grease buildup (anonymized)
- Data on cleaning frequency violations
- Tips for restaurant owners

Would you be interested in covering this angle? I'm available for a phone interview this week.

Hi [Property Manager Name],

I'm [Your Name] from LocalBizzList, serving commercial properties with restaurant tenants in [City].

If you manage shopping centers, mixed-use buildings, or malls with restaurant tenants, you know hood cleaning compliance can be a landlord headache:
- Tenants skip cleanings, violating lease terms
- Fire marshal citations affect the entire building
- Grease fires put the property at risk

**How We Help Property Managers**:
1. **Tenant Coordination**: We work directly with your restaurant tenants
2. **Compliance Tracking**: Alert you when tenants are overdue
3. **Building Access**: We handle roof access permits and coordination
4. **Documentation**: Provide landlord copy of Certificate of Performance

**Free Resource for Your Tenants**:
We've created an NFPA 96 compliance guide I can share with your restaurant tenants (link below). It explains their obligations under most commercial leases.

**Partnership Opportunity**:
We can become your "preferred hood cleaning vendor" for the property, giving tenants a vetted option and you peace of mind.

## Outreach Template 5: Mall Operators (Dock Access/Logistics Guide)

### Subject Lines

- C: "Roof Access Coordination: A Guide for Mall Operators"

### Email Body

```
Hi [Operations Manager],

I'm [Your Name] from LocalBizzList, serving food court and mall restaurant tenants across South Florida.

One challenge we see repeatedly: Mall restaurants struggle with hood cleaning logistics because of restricted roof/dock access, after-hours requirements, and building coordination.

**Common Issues**:
- Roof access permits take weeks to secure
- Cleaning schedules conflict with mall hours
- Dock access restricted or poorly coordinated
- Tenants don't know who to contact for approvals

**Solution: Free Logistics Guide**:
I've created a guide specifically for mall restaurants covering:
- How to request roof access permits
- After-hours cleaning coordination
- Dock scheduling best practices
- Building contact list template

I'd love to share this with your food court tenants and operations team.

**Partnership Opportunity**:
We can streamline the process for your property:
- Pre-approved vendor status (faster permits)
- Bulk scheduling for multiple tenants (one roof access day)
- Direct coordination with your facilities team

Would you be open to a call to discuss how we can make hood cleaning less of a headache for your tenants and your team?
