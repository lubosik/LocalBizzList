# Phase 4: Demo Content Purge from Feeds

## Purpose

Identify and archive all remaining demo/luxury content (private aviation, wealth management, luxury real estate) that may surface in feeds, search results, or components. This ensures only Restaurant Hood Cleaning content is visible in production.

## Files to Archive

### 1. Business Listings (Luxury/Wealth Demo Content)

**Impact**: Removes old blog post pages (resources now at /resources/{city}/{slug})
