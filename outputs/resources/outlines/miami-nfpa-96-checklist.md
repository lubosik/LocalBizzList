## H2: Introduction: Why This Checklist Matters for Miami Restaurants

**Paragraph Prompt (130-150 words):**
Miami-Dade County health inspectors check hood cleaning compliance on every routine inspection—and missing or expired Certificate of Performance is an automatic 4-point violation. With re-inspection fees starting at $500 and potential closure orders for repeat violations, verifying your system meets NFPA 96 standards isn't optional.

This checklist gives you the same 30 inspection points fire marshals and health inspectors use to evaluate "to bare metal" compliance. Whether you're preparing for an inspection, verifying your cleaning contractor's work, or training your facilities team, this guide ensures nothing gets missed.

Designed specifically for Miami's requirements: Miami-Dade quarterly cleaning mandates, high-rise duct systems in Brickell towers, humidity-accelerated grease buildup, and bi-lingual documentation needs.

**Components:**
- Intro paragraph
- Quick takeaway callout: "Use this before every inspection—catch violations before inspectors do."

## H2: What NFPA 96 Requires in Miami-Dade County

**Paragraph Prompt (160-180 words):**
NFPA 96 (Standard for Ventilation Control and Fire Protection of Commercial Cooking Operations) mandates "to bare metal" cleaning of all grease-removal devices—hoods, ducts, fans, plenums—at intervals based on usage volume.

**Miami-Dade Amendment:** County fire code requires **quarterly cleaning (every 3 months)** for all commercial kitchens operating more than 12 hours per day, regardless of cooking volume. This is stricter than base NFPA 96, which allows semi-annual cleaning for moderate-volume kitchens.

Who enforces: Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Prevention Bureau + Environmental Health inspectors. Inspectors cross-reference your Certificate of Performance date against kitchen usage hours during routine health inspections.

Penalties:
- Missing/expired certificate: 4-point violation, mandatory re-inspection ($500 fee)
- Grease depth >1/8" in ducts: Fire code violation, possible kitchen shutdown
- No cleaning records: Insurance claim denial if fire occurs

**Components:**
- Text paragraphs
- NFPA 96 Frequency Table (with Miami-Dade Amendment column)

**Table:**
| Usage Class | Kitchen Type | NFPA 96 Baseline | Miami-Dade Requirement |
|------------|--------------|------------------|------------------------|
| High Volume | 24hr diners, hotel kitchens | Quarterly | ✅ Quarterly (enforced) |
| Moderate Volume | Full-service restaurants >12hr/day | Semi-Annually | ⚠️ Quarterly (county override) |
| Low Volume | Seasonal, <12hr/day | Annually | ✅ Annually (baseline OK) |
| Solid Fuel | Wood-fired pizza, charcoal | Monthly | ✅ Monthly (enforced) |

## H2: Common Inspector Red Flags in Miami

**Paragraph Prompt (180-200 words):**
Miami-Dade health inspectors know what to look for. These violations trigger automatic re-inspection:

**1. Certificate Date Violations (Most Common)**
- Certificate >90 days old (quarterly mandate)
- Certificate missing contractor license number
- Certificate unsigned or illegible

**2. Visible Grease Residue**
- Hood interior shows grease film (failed "to bare metal")
- Grease dripping from hood onto cook line
- Duct access panels show grease depth >1/8"

**3. Documentation Gaps**
- No certificate posted or on file
- Certificate from unlicensed contractor (Florida Fire Marshal License required)
- No insurance proof (Miami-Dade requires $2M liability minimum)

**4. Structural Issues**
- Missing duct access panels (can't verify interior cleaning)
- Corroded fan mounts (salt air damage, common in coastal Miami)
- Grease leaking onto roof (Fire code + building code violation)

**5. Miami-Specific Failures**
- High-rise ducts not cleaned full height (only accessible sections done)
- Certificate doesn't specify vertical duct cleaned (required for Brickell towers)

**Components:**
- Text paragraphs
- Callout box: "If inspector cites any of these, expect $500+ re-inspection fee + 4-point violation"

## H2: How Inspectors Evaluate "To Bare Metal" Compliance

**Paragraph Prompt (150-170 words):**
"To bare metal" doesn't mean "looks clean from outside." Inspectors use three tests:

**1. Grease Depth Gauge Test**
- Insert calibrated gauge into duct through access panel
- Measure grease thickness at multiple points
- Pass: ≤1/8" residue; Fail: >1/8" or visible grease coating

**2. White Glove Test (Informal)**
- Run gloved hand inside hood/duct surface
- Pass: Minimal transfer, metal visible; Fail: Glove coated in grease

**3. Photo Documentation Review**
- Inspectors check Certificate of Performance for before/after photos
- Verify photos show bare metal (not just "cleaner" surfaces)
- Miami-Dade inspectors may upload photos to health portal

**Certificate Requirements (Miami-Dade):**
- Service date + time
- Contractor name, license #, phone
- Areas cleaned (hood, ducts—specify footage, fan, plenum)
- Next service due date (based on usage class)
- Technician signature + certification (IKECA, NFPA 96 trained)
- Insurance certificate reference ($2M liability)

**Components:**
- Text paragraphs
- Image: Sample Certificate of Performance (annotated with required fields)
- Checklist: "What Your Miami Certificate Must Include" (8 items)
