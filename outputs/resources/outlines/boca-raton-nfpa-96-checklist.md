- [ ] **Insurance certificate submitted:** $2M liability + workers comp to club 5 days ahead
- [ ] **Background checks on file:** Level 2 for crew accessing private clubs
- [ ] **Photo package for club records:** Bound printed report + digital (not just emailed)

(Same 3-phase structure as Miami checklist, but remove Miami-specific items like bi-lingual, high-rise rope access. Add Boca items: seasonal timing, club protocols)

Palm Beach County health inspectors focus on:
1. Certificate documentation (liquor license renewals)
2. Country club photo proof (insurance audits)
3. Mizner Park/Town Center COI compliance (property management)

### H2: White-Glove Service Standards
Boca upscale expectations:
- Uniformed crews (branded polos, no torn clothing)

- Discreet waste disposal (no grease bins visible to public)
