## Structure

### H2: Introduction
Why frequency matters (fire risk, insurance, Miami-Dade quarterly mandate). Who this helps (GMs scheduling maintenance, new owners establishing compliance programs).

### H2: NFPA 96 Usage Classes Explained
4 usage classes (High/Moderate/Low/Solid Fuel) + how to calculate your restaurant's class (hours/day + cooking volume + fuel type).

**Decision Tree:**
- Open >16hrs/day + frying/grilling? → High Volume → Quarterly
- Open 12-16hrs/day + moderate cooking? → Moderate → Semi-Annual (BUT Miami-Dade overrides to Quarterly)
- Open <12hrs/day + light cooking? → Low Volume → Annually
- Wood-fired/charcoal? → Solid Fuel → Monthly

### H2: Miami-Dade Quarterly Mandate
County amendment requiring quarterly for ALL kitchens >12hrs/day. Table comparing NFPA baseline vs. Miami-Dade requirement by restaurant type.

**Table:** Restaurant Type | Hours/Day | NFPA Interval | Miami-Dade Requirement
- 24hr Diner | 24 | Quarterly | Quarterly (same)
- Full-Service Restaurant | 14 | Semi-Annual | ⚠️ Quarterly (stricter)
- Fast Casual | 10 | Annually | Annually (same)
- Hotel Kitchen | 18 | Quarterly | Quarterly (same)

### H2: Cost Impact of Cleaning Frequency
Annual cost comparison: Quarterly ($1,600-2,000) vs. Semi-Annual ($800-1,200). Miami-specific: high-rise surcharge, bi-lingual coordination (no extra cost).

**Cost Calculator Section:** Input your kitchen type → outputs recommended frequency + annual cost estimate → CTA to pricing calculator.

### H2: How to Track Your Cleaning Schedule
- Calendar reminder system (30 days before due)
- Certificate tracking (file in binder, upload to Miami-Dade portal)
- Vendor auto-reminders (most Miami cleaners offer)
- Penalties for missed intervals (re-inspection fees, insurance issues)

### H2: What If You Miss Your Due Date?
Consequences: health inspection violation, $500 re-inspection fee, insurance claim denial. Miami-Dade grace period: ZERO (even 1 day late = violation). Emergency same-day cleaning option (+50% rush fee).

### H2: Industry-Specific Frequency Requirements in Miami
Special cases:
- **Hotels (South Beach, Downtown):** Multiple kitchens = stagger schedules (avoid all-at-once disruption)
- **Hospitals (Jackson, Baptist Health):** Quarterly mandatory regardless of volume (healthcare code)
- **Cruise Terminal Commissaries (PortMiami):** Monthly (high volume + tight inspection windows)
- **Country Clubs (transferring to Boca article):** Seasonal considerations
