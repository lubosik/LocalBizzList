## Structure

### H2: Introduction
Why exhaust fans fail in Miami (salt air corrosion, humidity, grease saturation). Cost of downtime ($500-2,000/day lost revenue + health code violations). Who this helps (GMs, maintenance staff).

### H2: Miami-Specific Fan Challenges
- **Salt Air Corrosion:** Coastal Miami Beach, Brickell Bay—fan blades rust 3× faster
- **Humidity:** 80-90% year-round = accelerated grease oxidation, mold in ducts
- **High-Rise Vibration:** 20-40 storey buildings = motor mount stress from wind/vibration

### H2: 8 Common Exhaust Fan Problems in Miami

**Problem/Solution Table:**

| Problem | Symptoms | DIY Quick Fix | When to Call Professional |
|---------|----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **1. Fan Won't Start** | No sound, no airflow | Check breaker, reset switch | If breaker OK but fan dead (motor failure) |
| **2. Weak Airflow/Smoke Backup** | Smoke in dining room, odors | Clean filters, check fan running | If fan running but still smoking (duct blockage) |
| **3. Loud Squealing/Grinding Noise** | Screeching, metal-on-metal | Check belt tension (if belt-driven) | If noise persists (bearing failure, $800-1,500 repair) |
| **4. Excessive Vibration** | Fan shaking, rattling | Tighten motor mounts | If mounts tight but still vibrating (blade imbalance, $400-800) |
| **5. Grease Dripping from Fan** | Grease puddles on roof | Empty grease cups | If cups empty but still dripping (plenum full, needs cleaning) |
| **6. Fan Runs But No Suction** | Airflow weak, hood ineffective | Check damper open, fan direction | If direction correct but no pull (fan backwards or duct detached) |
| **7. Rusted/Corroded Blades (Miami-Specific)** | Visible rust, pitting on blades | Apply anti-corrosion spray | If rust severe (blade replacement $600-1,200) |
| **8. Intermittent Operation** | Fan starts/stops randomly | Check thermostat, loose wiring | If wiring tight (motor overheating, needs replacement) |

### H2: Coastal Corrosion Prevention (Miami Beach, Brickell Bay)
- Anti-corrosion spray application (food-safe silicone, apply quarterly)
- Stainless steel vs. galvanized (stainless lasts 2× longer in salt air)
- Fan housing seal inspection (prevent salt intrusion)
- Accelerated replacement cycle (expect 7-10yrs vs. 15yrs inland)

### H2: Emergency vs. Scheduled Repair Decision Guide
When to call 24/7 emergency:
- Fan dead during service (no exhaust = kitchen shutdown)
- Grease fire in duct/fan (post-Ansul activation)
- Health inspector on-site, fan non-functional

Can wait for scheduled service:
- Minor noise (bearings wearing but functional)
- Slight vibration (annoying but not dangerous)
- Grease drips (manageable with cup emptying)

### H2: DIY Maintenance Checklist (Monthly)
- [ ] Empty grease cups
- [ ] Check belt tension (1" deflection with thumb pressure)
- [ ] Listen for bearing noise
- [ ] Inspect blades for grease buildup
- [ ] Test fan switch operation
- [ ] Check motor mounts tight
- [ ] Verify damper opens fully

### H2: When DIY Becomes Dangerous
Don't attempt if:
- Rooftop fan on high-rise (fall risk, OSHA violation)
- Electrical panel work (licensed electrician required)
- Motor replacement (heavy equipment, wiring risk)
- Post-fire inspection (structural damage assessment needs pro)

### H2: Miami Fan Repair Costs
Average Miami pricing:
- Belt replacement: $150-250
- Bearing replacement: $400-800
- Motor replacement: $1,200-2,500
- Blade balancing: $300-600
- Full fan unit replacement: $3,000-8,000 (high-rise higher)

Emergency after-hours surcharge: +50%

### H2: FAQs (10 questions)
- How often should I check my exhaust fan? [[TODO—Monthly visual, quarterly pro service]]
- Can I run kitchen if fan is weak but working? [[TODO—No, health code requires proper ventilation]]
- How do I know if fan is backwards? [[TODO—Hold paper near hood, should pull strongly]]
- Does Miami salt air void fan warranties? [[TODO—Check manufacturer, most exclude corrosion]]
