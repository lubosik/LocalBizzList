## Section 1: Why Restaurant Hood Cleaning Prevents Grease Fires

Grease buildup in exhaust systems causes 57% of restaurant fires annually. When cooking vapours travel through your hood and ductwork, grease condenses on interior surfaces—creating a flammable coating that can ignite from a single flare-up. Once fire enters the duct system, it spreads rapidly through hidden spaces where sprinklers can't reach.

Surface wiping of visible hood areas does nothing to address the real problem: grease deposits layered inside ducts, fan plenums, and rooftop exhaust components. A typical busy restaurant accumulates 1/4" of grease in ducts every 90 days—well above NFPA 96's safe threshold.

This is why fire marshals and insurance underwriters mandate professional to-bare-metal cleaning by certified technicians. Not a recommendation—a legal requirement tied to your operating permit and liability coverage.

## Section 2: Our 6-Step NFPA 96 Cleaning Process

Every job follows our proven 6-step protocol, refined over 15 years and 10,000+ cleanings across South Florida. You get transparency from inspection to certification—no shortcuts, no hidden corners left dirty.

### Step 1 – Pre-Cleaning Inspection & Documentation
Our technician photographs your system's current state, measures grease depth with a calibrated gauge, and notes the last cleaning date. We identify fire code violations (missing access panels, damaged filters, non-compliant duct construction) and review your kitchen's usage hours to confirm the correct NFPA cleaning interval.

**Output:** Pre-cleaning photo report, fire hazard assessment, estimated service time.

### Step 2 – Kitchen Prep & Safety Setup
We protect your cook line with heavy-duty sheeting, set up drip containment for runoff, and shut off exhaust fans and pilot lights. For 24-hour operations, we coordinate with your manager to schedule cleaning during off-hours—typically 11pm to 6am to avoid disrupting service.

Hotels and hospitals require extra coordination: we work with facilities teams to temporarily disable fire alarm zones (reactivated immediately post-cleaning).
