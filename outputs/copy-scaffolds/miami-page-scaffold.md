## Section 1: Why Miami Restaurants Need More Frequent Hood Cleaning

Miami-Dade County enforces NFPA 96 with local amendments that often require quarterly cleaning for commercial kitchens operating more than 12 hours per day—stricter than the base standard. If your restaurant, hotel, or hospital kitchen runs extended hours, you're likely subject to this accelerated schedule.

South Florida's extreme humidity (80-90% year-round) compounds the problem. Grease deposits absorb moisture from the air, creating acrid smoke when reheated during service. This smoke backs up into dining areas, creating odour complaints and triggering ventilation failure citations from health inspectors.

Coastal locations face an additional challenge: salt air corrodes fan motors and ductwork, accelerating wear and grease accumulation. A Brickell high-rise or Miami Beach oceanfront kitchen experiences corrosion rates 3× faster than inland properties.

When Miami-Dade Environmental Health inspectors visit, they check your Certificate of Performance date first. Missing or expired certificate = automatic 4-point violation and mandatory re-inspection fees upwards of $500.
