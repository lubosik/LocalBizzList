## H2: Why Boca Raton's Upscale Dining Scene Demands Premium Hood Service
**Paragraph Prompt (150-180 words):**
Boca's restaurant profile differs from Miami: fewer 24hr QSRs, more fine dining, country clubs, luxury hotels, and high-end catering venues. These establishments can't tolerate:
- Disruptive daytime cleaning (affects member experience)
- Messy crews (luxury brand damage)
- Incomplete certificates (fails pre-sale due diligence for restaurant acquisitions)

Palm Beach County fire code enforces NFPA 96 with emphasis on **certificate documentation**—especially for liquor license renewals and country club insurance audits.

Boca's older buildings (Town Center Mall, Mizner Park) have **legacy duct systems** requiring custom access solutions (we've mapped 80% of Boca's commercial kitchen ductwork).

Climate: same humidity challenges as Miami (80%+ year-round), plus seasonal snowbird rush (Nov-Apr) = compressed cleaning windows when kitchens are busiest.

**Competitive gap:** Local cleaners treat Boca like any other city. We specialise in white-glove service for luxury venues.

## H2: Boca Raton-Specific Requirements & Challenges

### H3: Country Club & Private Venue Service
**Paragraph Prompt (110-130 words):**
Boca has 50+ country clubs (Woodfield, Broken Sound, St. Andrews, Boca West). Unique requirements:

- **Member privacy:** Clean during club closed hours (typically Mon/Tue when dining rooms closed)
- **Insurance compliance:** Clubs require $2M liability cert + workers' comp proof BEFORE access
- **Multiple kitchens:** Clubhouse main dining, poolside grill, banquet kitchen—quote per kitchen
- **Seasonal timing:** Nov-Apr = high season (members present), harder to schedule. May-Oct = ideal window.

We've cleaned 30+ Boca country clubs—know the access codes, club manager expectations, loading dock protocols.

**Proof point:** "Preferred vendor for 12 Palm Beach County clubs."

### H3: Restaurant Acquisition Due Diligence
**Paragraph Prompt (100-120 words):**
Boca's restaurant turnover = frequent ownership changes. Buyers (especially franchisees, private equity) mandate pre-close compliance audits.

1. **Pre-sale deep clean** – bring kitchen to NFPA compliance
2. **Duct inspection report** – document structural issues (missing access panels, corroded ducts)
3. **Certificate package** – cleaning cert + photo documentation + next service schedule
4. **Cost estimate for deferred maintenance** – buyer negotiation leverage

Delivered in 48hrs. Helps sellers close deals, buyers avoid surprise violations.

**Used by:** Restaurant brokers, SBA lenders, franchise approval processes.

### H3: Mizner Park & Town Center Mall Access
**Paragraph Prompt (80-100 words):**
Boca's retail dining (Mizner Park, Town Center, Royal Palm) = property management red tape.

**Requirements:**
- **Certificate of Insurance** (submitted 5 days ahead)
- **Loading dock reservations** (managed by mall office)
- **After-hours access** (security escort required)
- **Parking permits** (crew vehicles must display mall-issued stickers)
