## H2: Why Restaurant Hood Cleaning Prevents Grease Fires
**Paragraph Prompt (120-150 words):**
Open with the fire hazard reality: grease buildup in exhaust systems is the #1 cause of restaurant fires (cite NFPA or NFIR stat if available). Explain how grease vaporises during cooking, travels through ductwork, and condenses as flammable deposits. When ignition occurs (flare-up, electrical spark), these deposits fuel rapid fire spread into hidden ducts and plenums—areas sprinklers can't reach.

Emphasise that surface wiping of hoods does NOT address duct interiors where 90% of grease accumulates. Transition to "This is why NFPA 96 mandates to-bare-metal cleaning by certified professionals."

**Photo Callout:** Before/after split image showing greasy duct vs. bare-metal cleaned duct.

## H2: What "To-Bare-Metal" Cleaning Means (NFPA 96 Standard)
**Paragraph Prompt (100-120 words):**
Define to-bare-metal: removal of ALL grease, residue, and carbon deposits down to the original metal surface of hoods, ducts, plenums, and fans. Not a spray-and-wipe job. Requires hand-scraping with tools, hot alkaline degreasers (180-200°F), and high-pressure water (1500+ PSI).

Explain scope: interior hood surfaces, filters, grease traps, ductwork (horizontal and vertical runs), fan housings, roof plenums, and exhaust stacks. Accessible via access panels, roof hatches, or wall cut-ins.

Mention Certificate of Performance: required by fire marshals, insurance companies, and health inspectors as proof of compliance.

**Photo Callout:** Technician hand-scraping grease from duct interior.

## H2: NFPA 96 Cleaning Frequency Requirements
**Paragraph Prompt (80-100 words):**
Introduce NFPA 96 Table 11.4: cleaning intervals based on "usage class" (cooking volume + hours). Emphasise this is NOT optional—it's required by fire code and enforced by local fire marshals. Failure to comply = fines, insurance voids, closure orders.

Note: South Florida jurisdictions (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach) adopt NFPA 96 with local amendments—some require quarterly for all commercial kitchens regardless of volume.

**Table Callout:**

| Usage Class | Kitchen Type | NFPA 96 Interval |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **High Volume** | 24hr diners, QSR chains, hotel kitchens | **Quarterly** (every 3 months) |
| **Moderate Volume** | Full-service restaurants, cafeterias | **Semi-Annually** (every 6 months) |
| **Low Volume** | Churches, seasonal venues, country clubs | **Annually** (every 12 months) |
| **Solid Fuel** | Wood-fired pizza, charcoal grills | **Monthly** (every 30 days) |

**Paragraph after table (40-60 words):**
Our technicians assess your kitchen's usage class during the initial inspection and recommend the compliant schedule. We send automatic reminders 30 days before your next service due date—never risk a violation.

## H2: Our 6-Step NFPA 96 Cleaning Process
**Intro Paragraph (60-80 words):**
Every job follows our proven 6-step protocol, developed over 15 years and 10,000+ cleanings. We don't cut corners. From pre-cleaning documentation to post-service certification, you get transparency, safety, and guaranteed compliance.

### H3: Step 1 – Pre-Cleaning Inspection & Documentation
**Paragraph Prompt (80-100 words):**
Technician photographs current state, measures grease depth in ducts (using calibrated depth gauge), notes last cleaning date. Identifies fire code violations (missing access panels, damaged filters, non-compliant duct construction). Reviews kitchen usage hours to confirm NFPA interval compliance.

Outputs: Pre-cleaning photo report, fire hazard assessment, estimated cleaning time.

**Photo Callout:** Inspector measuring grease depth in duct with ruler.

### H3: Step 2 – Kitchen Prep & Safety Setup
**Paragraph Prompt (70-90 words):**
Protect cook line: cover ranges, fryers, grills with heavy-duty plastic sheeting. Set up drip containment for degreaser runoff. Shut off exhaust fans and pilot lights. Coordinate with kitchen manager to schedule cleaning during off-hours (typically 11pm-6am for 24hr operations).

For hotels/hospitals: coordinate with facilities to disable fire alarm zones temporarily (reactivate immediately post-cleaning).

**Photo Callout:** Plastic sheeting covering commercial kitchen equipment.

### H3: Step 3 – Hood & Filter Degreasing
**Paragraph Prompt (90-110 words):**
Remove baffle or mesh filters → soak in 190°F alkaline degreaser bath (20-30 min). While soaking, hand-scrape hood interior walls, grease troughs, and capture plenums using non-sparking scrapers. Apply hot alkaline foam, dwell 10 min, then pressure wash (1500 PSI) to bare metal.

Inspect grease cup/drain—clean or replace if corroded. Reinstall filters only after 100% dry (prevent mould in humid climates).

Result: Hood interior shines like new stainless steel. No grease film, no carbon residue.

**Photo Callout:** Before/after hood interior comparison (split screen).

### H3: Step 4 – Duct & Plenum Cleaning (The Critical Step)
**Paragraph Prompt (120-150 words):**
This is where most "cheap" cleaners fail—they skip ducts because they're hard to access. We don't. Access ducts via:
- Roof hatches (vertical ducts in multi-storey buildings)
- Wall panels (horizontal duct runs)
- Engineered access doors (installed per NFPA 96 for cleanability)

Technician enters duct (if diameter permits) or uses extension tools. Hand-scrape grease deposits from duct walls, corners, seams. Vacuum bulk grease into collection bins. Pressure wash from bottom (hood connection) to top (rooftop fan) to flush remaining grease.

For high-rise buildings (common in Miami/Brickell): certified rope-access technicians clean vertical ducts 10+ storeys tall.

Inspect for fire damage, corrosion, missing weld seams—report structural issues to client.

**Photo Callout:** Technician inside duct with scraper tool (hard hat, respirator).

### H3: Step 5 – Exhaust Fan & Rooftop Service
**Paragraph Prompt (90-110 words):**
Rooftop upblast or inline fan: remove grease from fan blades, motor housing, discharge plenum, and grease cups. Grease-saturated fan blades become unbalanced → motor failure → $3,000+ repair.

Check fan belt tension (if belt-driven), lubricate bearings (if accessible), inspect motor mounts for corrosion (salt air issue in coastal areas like Miami Beach).

Clean exterior fan housing and grease drainage—prevent grease drips onto roof membrane (causes leaks).

Test fan operation post-cleaning: confirm proper RPM, no vibration, no grease spray.

**Photo Callout:** Side-by-side of greasy fan blades vs. cleaned blades.

### H3: Step 6 – Final Inspection & Certificate Issuance
**Paragraph Prompt (80-100 words):**
Post-cleaning walkthrough: verify all surfaces to bare metal, grease depth ≤ NFPA limits (typically <1/8" residue acceptable in some areas, but we aim for zero).

Photograph cleaned hood, duct access points, fan blades. Compare to pre-cleaning photos.

Issue **Certificate of Performance**: includes service date, technician name/license, areas cleaned, next service due date, company insurance/license numbers. Certificate meets requirements for:
- Fire marshal inspections
- Health department audits
- Insurance policy compliance
- Restaurant sale/acquisition due diligence

Email certificate + photo report within 24 hours.
