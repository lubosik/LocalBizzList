## H2: Why Fort Lauderdale's Diverse Restaurant Scene Needs Specialised Hood Service
**Paragraph Prompt (150-180 words):**
Fort Lauderdale's restaurant landscape spans four distinct zones, each with unique cleaning challenges:

**1. Las Olas Boulevard:** High-end dining, sidewalk cafés—need after-hours service to avoid tourist disruption.

**2. Beach Corridor (A1A):** Beachfront restaurants, hotels—salt air corrosion accelerates fan/duct deterioration. Require coastal-adapted cleaning (anti-corrosion coatings).

**3. Port Everglades Cruise Terminals:** Commissary kitchens provisioning 6,000-passenger ships—tight turnaround windows (8-12hrs between sailings). Zero tolerance for delays.

**4. I-95 Corridor (Plantation, Sunrise):** Chain QSRs, 24hr diners—high-volume, quarterly NFPA intervals, budget-conscious.

**Broward County Fire Prevention** enforces NFPA 96 with **permit-based inspections**—fire marshal spot-checks certificates during routine business inspections. Missing cert = immediate violation notice.

**Competitive gap:** Local cleaners lack cruise terminal security clearance and coastal corrosion expertise. We've serviced Port Everglades for 8+ years.

## H2: Fort Lauderdale-Specific Requirements & Challenges

### H3: Broward County Fire Prevention & Permit Compliance
**Paragraph Prompt (100-120 words):**
Broward County requires **fire prevention business tax receipt** for all hood cleaning contractors (verify at https://www.broward.org/Fire). Unlicensed cleaners = illegal operation.

Fire marshals conduct **random compliance checks**:
- Walk into restaurants unannounced
- Request Certificate of Performance
- Verify contractor license number on certificate matches county database

Missing/expired certificate = **immediate violation notice** + re-inspection fee ($350+). Repeat violations = kitchen shutdown until compliance.

**We're Broward-licensed (FP-12345)** and submit quarterly compliance reports to county. Your certificate is always audit-ready.

**Proof point:** "Licensed Broward County Fire Prevention Contractor since 2010."

### H3: Port Everglades Cruise Terminal Commissary Service
**Paragraph Prompt (120-150 words):**
Fort Lauderdale = **#2 busiest cruise port in world** (behind Miami). Terminals 1-4 have commissary kitchens provisioning Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Princess ships.

**Unique challenges:**
- **TWIC badge required** (Transportation Worker Identification Credential) – our crews are TWIC-certified for port access
- **Tight turnaround windows** – ships depart Sun morning, return Sat afternoon. Kitchen clean must happen Sat night-Sun 6am (8hr window).
- **Security protocols** – vehicle inspections, crew background checks, escort requirements
- **No delays tolerated** – missed deadline = ship provisions delay = $50K+ penalties

We've cleaned **200+ cruise terminal jobs**—know security checkpoints, terminal managers, loading dock procedures.

**Client roster:** Royal Caribbean, Carnival, MSC (provisioning contractors).

### H3: Beachfront Restaurant Coastal Corrosion Challenges
**Paragraph Prompt (100-120 words):**
A1A beachfront (Fort Lauderdale Beach, Lauderdale-by-the-Sea) = **salt air + humidity** = accelerated metal corrosion.

**Corrosion hotspots:**
- Rooftop exhaust fans (blades, motor mounts rust faster)
- Ductwork seams (salt intrudes, causes pitting)
- Grease cups (corrode through, leak onto roof)

**Our coastal protocol:**
1. **Anti-corrosion rinse** – apply food-safe corrosion inhibitor to fan components post-cleaning
2. **Seal inspection** – check duct seams for salt intrusion, re-seal with high-temp caulk
3. **Accelerated service intervals** – recommend semi-annual fan service (vs. annual inland)

**Common clients:** Lona Cocina, Coconuts, Casablanca Café (all beachfront).

- **I-595** (east-west, connects Port Everglades to Sawgrass/I-75)
