## Schema Implementation Notes for Cursor

1. **Placement:** Add JSON-LD scripts to `<head>` of each page using Next.js `<Script>` component with `type="application/ld+json"`

2. **FAQ Schema:** Only populate with answers marked `schema_eligible: true` in frontmatter

3. **LocalBusiness Coordinates:** Use city center coords (provided above). For production, consider actual business address.

4. **Phone Numbers:**
   - Miami: (305) 555-HOOD â†’ +1-305-555-4663
   - Boca: (561) 555-HOOD â†’ +1-561-555-4663
   - Fort Lauderdale: (954) 555-HOOD â†’ +1-954-555-4663
   - **Note:** These are placeholder numbers. Replace with real numbers before launch.

5. **Image URLs:** Replace placeholder image URLs with actual hosted images once assets are uploaded.

6. **BreadcrumbList:** Ensure each position increments correctly and matches actual nav structure.
