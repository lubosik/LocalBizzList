# Phase 2 Information Architecture TODOs

## Content Symmetry Model

```
Service Pages (3 total):
â”œâ”€â”€ restaurant-hood-cleaning (Phase 1) âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ exhaust-fan-service (Phase 2)
â””â”€â”€ nfpa-96-inspection (Phase 2)

Cities (3 total):
â”œâ”€â”€ Miami
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hood-cleaning (Phase 1) âœ…
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exhaust-fan-service (Phase 2)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nfpa-96-inspection (Phase 2)
â”œâ”€â”€ Boca Raton
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hood-cleaning (Phase 1) âœ…
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exhaust-fan-service (Phase 2)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nfpa-96-inspection (Phase 2)
â””â”€â”€ Fort Lauderdale
    â”œâ”€â”€ hood-cleaning (Phase 1) âœ…
    â”œâ”€â”€ exhaust-fan-service (Phase 2)
    â””â”€â”€ nfpa-96-inspection (Phase 2)
```

**Final Grid:** 3 services Ã— 3 cities = **9 location pages** + **3 service pages** = **12 total pages**

---

## Phase 2 Triggers (When to Build)

Execute Phase 2 when **any** of these conditions are met:

1. âœ… **Phase 1 Local Pack visibility**
   - All 3 cities ranking in Map Pack for "hood cleaning [city]"
   - Minimum 10 GMB reviews per location

2. âœ… **Organic traffic threshold**
   - 500+ monthly organic visits from Phase 1 pages
   - 15+ qualified leads/month from hood cleaning alone

3. âœ… **Service expansion demand**
   - 20+ inbound requests for fan repair or inspection-only services
   - Customer feedback indicates need for standalone offerings

4. âœ… **Competitive gap identified**
   - Competitors ranking for "exhaust fan repair" with thin content
   - NFPA inspection-only opportunity (pre-sale, compliance audits)

---

## Phase 2 Preparation Checklist

Before building Phase 2 pages:

- [ ] Validate service delivery capability (fan repair techs, inspection certifications)
- [ ] Update `/pricing/instant-quote` calculator with new service types
- [ ] Gather 20 fan-repair-specific FAQs from Semrush/Perplexity
- [ ] Photograph fan motor replacements, inspection reports for content
- [ ] Create dedicated schema for fan service + inspection
- [ ] Update sitemap to include new service types
- [ ] Extend internal linking strategy (service â†” location cross-links)

---

## Notes for Cursor

- **Reuse Phase 1 templates:** Location page structure identical, just swap service type
- **Frontmatter schema:** Already designed to support multiple service types (see `frontmatter-examples.md`)
- **Content differentiation:** Each service type needs unique `process_steps`, `common_problems`, and `proof` sections
- **Internal links:** Phase 2 pages link back to Phase 1 hood cleaning pages ("Full system service includes...")

---

**Status:** Planning complete, awaiting Phase 1 validation metrics
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 must prove Local Pack + conversion model
**Timeline:** Estimate Q2 2025 (90 days post Phase 1 launch)
