The highest-scoring niche from our previous study was **Luxury Pet Grooming and Spa Services at 67/100 (MODERATE difficulty)**.

## Recommendations for 90+ Score Strategy

### Option 1: Redefine Scoring Weights
To achieve 90+ scores, we could:
- **Increase CPC Weight**: High CPC = high-value clients (currently underweighted)
- **Add Transaction Value Metric**: Factor in average deal size
- **Decrease Volume Weight**: Luxury doesn't need high volume
- **Add Referral Potential Score**: Some niches thrive on word-of-mouth

**New Potential Scoring:**
- **Demand (20%)**: Search volume + CPC (reduced from 25%)
- **Transaction Value (20%)**: Average deal size (NEW)
- **Competition (25%)**: Keyword difficulty (reduced from 35%)
- **Local Pack (10%)**: Map pack presence (reduced from 15%)
- **Content Gap (10%)**: Underserved queries (reduced from 15%)
- **Seasonality (5%)**: Trend stability (reduced from 10%)
- **Referral Potential (10%)**: Word-of-mouth strength (NEW)

---

### Option 2: Focus on Broader Service Categories
Instead of "luxury private chef miami", target:
- "Private chef services" (broader)
- "Personal chef hire" (broader)
- "Executive chef for hire" (broader)

This captures more search volume while still targeting high-net-worth clients.

---

### Option 3: Multi-Service Luxury Business Model
Combine multiple luxury services under one brand:
- **"Luxury Lifestyle Services Miami"**
- Offers: Private chef + concierge + property management + personal training
- Each service cross-sells to the others
- Higher lifetime customer value

---
