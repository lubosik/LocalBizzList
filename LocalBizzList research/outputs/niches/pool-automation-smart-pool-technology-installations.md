## Scoring Breakdown

| Factor | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Demand** | 88% | 25% | 22 |
| **Competition** | 80% | 35% | 28 |
| **Local Pack Friendliness** | 87% | 15% | 13 |
| **Content Gap & Intent** | 93% | 15% | 14 |
| **Seasonality** | 70% | 10% | 7 |
| **TOTAL RANKABILITY** | | | **84/100** |

### Factor Rationale

**Demand (88%):** Strong local search volume (260-520 monthly for top terms) with growing trend. Miami shows 80% higher interest than US average, reflecting affluent market and pool density. Seasonal peaks align with pool usage but year-round base demand exists.

**Competition (80%):** Moderate competition with directories dominating but no strong specialized players. Local businesses have basic presence but lack depth in content, education, and transparency. Significant white space for a comprehensive authority site.

**Local Pack Friendliness (87%):** Local Pack appears in 40% of queries. Service-based with strong local intent. Good potential for local rankings with proper GMB optimization and location-specific content.

**Content Gap & Intent (93%):** MASSIVE content gaps across the board‚Äîno brand comparisons, smart home guides, ROI calculators, technical specs, or installation documentation. Competitors lack educational depth, creating blue ocean for authority-building.

**Seasonality (70%):** Moderate seasonal variation (40% higher April-August) but strong year-round base. Miami climate supports continuous pool use, reducing seasonality risk compared to northern markets.
