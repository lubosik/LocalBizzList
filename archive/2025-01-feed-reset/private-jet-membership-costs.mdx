## Jet Card Programs: Predictable Pricing and Priority Access

Jet card programs represent a middle ground between pure charter and fractional ownership. These programs require an upfront deposit that you draw down as you fly, typically offering guaranteed availability and fixed hourly rates.

### How Jet Cards Work

You purchase a predetermined number of flight hours by depositing funds into an account with a jet card provider. Most programs are sold in 25-hour increments, though some offer 10 or 50-hour options. As you book flights, hours are deducted from your balance at fixed rates that are locked in at purchase.

### Jet Card Pricing

**Light Jet Cards (25 hours)**
- Deposit: $125,000 - $150,000
- Hourly rate: $5,000 - $6,000
- Peak day surcharges: $1,000 - $2,000 per hour
- Daily minimums: 2-3 hours

**Midsize Jet Cards (25 hours)**
- Deposit: $175,000 - $225,000
- Hourly rate: $7,000 - $9,000
- Peak day surcharges: $1,500 - $2,500 per hour
- Daily minimums: 2-3 hours

**Large Cabin Jet Cards (25 hours)**
- Deposit: $250,000 - $350,000
- Hourly rate: $10,000 - $14,000
- Peak day surcharges: $2,000 - $3,000 per hour
- Daily minimums: 3-4 hours

*Most jet card programs have expiration dates ranging from 12 to 36 months from purchase.*

## Fractional Ownership: Part Owner, Full Benefits

Fractional ownership allows you to purchase a share of a specific aircraft, typically in 1/16th increments (50 hours annually) up to 1/2 shares (400 hours annually). This model provides the consistency of a dedicated aircraft with the flexibility of guaranteed access to a fleet.

### Fractional Ownership Costs

**Light Jet 1/8 Share (100 hours)**
- Purchase price: $600,000 - $900,000
- Monthly management: $8,000 - $12,000

- Total annual cost: $346,000 - $494,000

**Midsize Jet 1/8 Share (100 hours)**
- Purchase price: $1,200,000 - $1,800,000
- Monthly management: $12,000 - $18,000
- Hourly occupied rate: $3,500 - $4,500
- Total annual cost: $494,000 - $666,000

**Large Cabin Jet 1/8 Share (100 hours)**
- Purchase price: $2,500,000 - $4,000,000
- Monthly management: $20,000 - $30,000
- Hourly occupied rate: $5,000 - $7,000
- Total annual cost: $740,000 - $1,060,000

*At the end of your contract (typically 5 years), you receive a percentage of the aircraft's fair market value when it's sold.*

## Full Aircraft Ownership: Complete Control

For individuals and families who fly 200+ hours annually, whole aircraft ownership may offer the best value and highest level of customization. You own the aircraft outright and maintain complete control over its operation, schedule, and configuration.

## Making the Right Choice

Selecting the optimal private aviation solution depends on several factors unique to your situation.

### Annual Flight Hour Guidelines

**Less than 25 hours annually:** On-demand charter offers the best value and flexibility without requiring capital commitment.

**25-50 hours annually:** Jet card programs provide cost predictability and guaranteed availability at a modest premium over charter.

**50-150 hours annually:** Fractional ownership becomes economically attractive, offering consistency and priority access.

**150+ hours annually:** Full ownership with professional management may offer the best value, particularly if you can generate charter revenue when not using the aircraft.
